Answer: 52390.272 for n = 2^20. Did not complete n = 2^30.<br>
Insight: Solved straightfowardly with a Python script to compute the answer. Optimizations took down n = 2^20 computing time from extremly high
to ~3 hours. O(n) solution (which was necessary for n = 2^30) is doable using a trick to compute the matrices quadratic forms linearly.
