# Puzzles

My insight and solutions to monthly puzzles by [Jane Street Capital](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/) and [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/index.shtml). 
I mainly spend time on these two monthly puzzles, but I'm interested in all forms of puzzles and puzzle competitions.
